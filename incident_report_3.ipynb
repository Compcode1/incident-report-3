    "#### **PROJECT INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am  are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. \n",
    "\n",
    "The former employee/ hacker executed a **brute force attack** to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the **administrative account** until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the **login credentials**, they were able to access the **admin panel** and **change the website’s source code**. They embedded a **javascript function** in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the hacker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the **malware**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the incident, you create a **sandbox environment** to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the **network protocol analyzer tcpdump**, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logs show the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser initiates a **DNS request**: It requests the **IP address** of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the **DNS server**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DNS** replies with the correct IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "The browser initiates an **HTTP request**: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the **IP address** sent by the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser initiates the download of the **malware**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser initiates a **DNS request** for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNS server responds with the **IP address** for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser initiates an **HTTP** request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a **brute force attack**. The disgruntled hacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website.  You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future."

    "**Incident Summary:** \n",
    "A former employee executed a **brute force attack** to guess the default administrative password for the web server. After gaining access to the admin panel, the attacker embedded a malicious JavaScript function into the website's source code. This function prompted users to download a file disguised as a browser update.\n",

    "The downloaded file contained a script that redirected users from yummyrecipesforme.com to the fake website greatrecipesforme.com, which hosted malware.\n",
    "The fake website caused users' computers to run slowly, likely due to the malware executing on their systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Investigation Findings:**\n",
    "DNS Resolution:\n",
    "The browser sent a DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com and received a response with the correct IP address.\n",
    "HTTP Requests:\n",
    "The browser initiated an HTTP request to yummyrecipesforme.com, triggering the malicious JavaScript to prompt a file download.\n",
    "Redirection:\n",
    "After running the file, the browser sent another DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com and connected to its IP address using HTTP.\n",

    "**Logs Confirm:**\n",

    "**Section 3: Recommend One Security Measure**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Measure:** Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Enforce Strong Password Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details:**\n",
    "Replace the default password with a strong, unique password following best practices (e.g., 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters).\n",
    "Implement MFA for administrative accounts to prevent unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.\n",
    "Enable account lockout policies to block login attempts after multiple failed attempts, mitigating brute force attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Measures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularly audit and update security controls.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation confirmed that a brute force attack exploited a default password to compromise the web server. The attacker embedded a malicious script, redirecting users to a fake website hosting malware. Implementing MFA and enforcing strong password policies will significantly reduce the risk of similar attacks in the future."
